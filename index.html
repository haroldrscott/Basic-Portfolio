			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<img id="Profile-Picture" src="assets/images/Profile_Picture.jpg">
			<p>I am learning web development in the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp in Gilbert. Upon completion of the course, I hope to transition into the tech field and utilize the skills developed during the six-month program. Currently an assistant facility manager at a 1-million-square-foot industrial site in Phoenix, I have 20 years experience in commercial facility/property management.</p>

			<p>A couple of hobbies I enjoy are hiking and backpacking. In September 2017 I climbed Mount Whitney, which at 14,505 feet, is the tallest mountain in the 48 contiguous states. I have been married to my wife, Tara, for 17 years. We have two daughters, Robyn and Emily, both of whom are in high school.</p>
